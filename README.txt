Overview
Project Name	Power to the Profile
Project Owner	Matthew Cintron 



Short Description	This project will focus on expanding data profile templates and techniques for both data bricks and AI/ML development by implementing templates for data profiling fast track libraries in data-bricks building out AI/ML assisted data infrastructure tools for tasks such as clustering and building out a template for standing up your own AI/ML profile tracker with ML flow.


Business Value	
Better and easier ways to profile large datasets quickly in data-bricks
A full road map to leveraging ML -flow to profile and review data from Model experiments
A larger tool set of data review options that leverage unsupervised learning AI to help with tasks like clustering
